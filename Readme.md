# üè´ **School Collaboration Platform - Smart Contract**

---

## üöÄ **Vision**

The **School Collaboration Platform** aims to foster collaborative learning and knowledge sharing between educational institutions. By leveraging **blockchain technology**, this platform creates a **decentralized and transparent environment** for schools to propose and accept joint projects. It ensures **trust, accountability, and immutability** of collaboration agreements, empowering schools to engage in meaningful educational partnerships globally.

## ‚ú® **Features**

### 1. **Decentralized Collaboration Requests**  
- Schools can initiate collaboration requests on-chain, ensuring **transparency** and **public verifiability**.
- The platform stores **project details** and maintains a clear record of pending or accepted requests.

### 2. **Immutable Records**  
- Every request is stored **immutably on the blockchain**, ensuring that agreements remain **tamper-proof**.
- Schools can rely on the platform for a **trusted history** of collaborations.

### 3. **Two-Way Approval Mechanism**  
- Schools can submit requests, while receiving schools must **explicitly accept** them.
- Ensures **mutual consent** before projects are initiated.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Contract Overview**

move
module SchoolCollabPlatform::CollabContract {

    use aptos_framework::signer;
    use std::string::String;

    struct CollaborationRequest has store, key {
        requesting_school: address,
        project_details: String,
        accepted: bool,
    }

    public fun create_request(
        requester: &signer, 
        project_details: String
    ) {
        let request = CollaborationRequest {
            requesting_school: signer::address_of(requester),
            project_details,
            accepted: false,
        };
        move_to(requester, request);
    }

    public fun accept_request(
        accepter: &signer, 
        requester_address: address
    ) acquires CollaborationRequest {
        let request = borrow_global_mut<CollaborationRequest>(requester_address);
        request.accepted = true;
    }
}
üìë Smart Contract Functionality
create_request(requester: &signer, project_details: String)

Creates a new collaboration request.
Stores the requesting school‚Äôs address, project details, and marks the request as pending.
accept_request(accepter: &signer, requester_address: address)

Allows the receiving school to accept a pending request.
Updates the request status to accepted = true.
üî≠ Future Scope
Frontend Interface Integration

Develop a web or mobile interface where schools can browse, propose, and accept collaborations.
Enable real-time notifications for request updates.
Multi-Party Collaborations

Extend the platform to support multi-school partnerships for larger projects or events.
Token Incentives

Introduce token-based incentives to reward active participants.
Schools earn tokens upon successful project milestones or collaboration achievements.
Project Progress Tracking

Add a milestone tracking feature to monitor project phases.
Schools can submit periodic reports to ensure smooth execution.
Global Collaborations

Facilitate cross-border collaborations between international schools using blockchain, reducing trust barriers.
üéØ Conclusion
The School Collaboration Platform empowers schools to build secure and decentralized partnerships. It bridges geographical gaps to promote educational growth through collaborative efforts. With planned upgrades, the platform aims to become a key driver in shaping global education by enabling schools to connect, collaborate, and grow‚Äîtogether.

### Explanation:
- **Emojis** add some visual flair to each section.  
- **Code blocks** for the smart contract are wrapped in triple backticks (` ```move `) for syntax highlighting.  
- **Headers** and **lists** make the content more readable and well-structured for a markdown file.  
- Each section is separated by a horizontal line (`---`) to enhance clarity.
